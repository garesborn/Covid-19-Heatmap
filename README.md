# Covid-19-Heatmap
Creating a heat map of Covid-19 spread throughout the US as of Feb 2021

Using [this data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv) and the plotly choropleth module, I have created a heat map gif of COVID-19 spread in the US. Data is represented as 7 day average of new cases per million inhabitants of a state.

NOTE: GIF only shows every other day, to meet githubs 10 MB file limit,
